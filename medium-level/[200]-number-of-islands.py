# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/

# Given an m x n 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), return the number
# of islands.

# An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically.
# You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

# Example 1:
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","1","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","1","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","0","0"]
# ]
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# Input: grid = [
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["1","1","0","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","1","0","0"],
#   ["0","0","0","1","1"]
# ]
# Output: 3
