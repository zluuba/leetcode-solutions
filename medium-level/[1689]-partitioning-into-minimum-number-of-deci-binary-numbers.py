# https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers/

# A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros.
# For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.
#
# Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number
# of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.

# Example 1:
# Input: n = "32"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: 10 + 11 + 11 = 32

# Example 2:
# Input: n = "82734"
# Output: 8

# Example 3:
# Input: n = "27346209830709182346"
# Output: 9


# Any length of number can be expressed through (maximum) 9 combinations of deci-binary numbers,
# so we just find the maximum digit in the number.
