# You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right.
# The trees are represented by an integer array fruits where fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
#
# You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has some strict rules that you must follow:
#
# You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
# There is no limit on the amount of fruit each basket can hold.
# Starting from any tree of your choice, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree (including the start tree)
# while moving to the right. The picked fruits must fit in one of your baskets.
# Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
# Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
