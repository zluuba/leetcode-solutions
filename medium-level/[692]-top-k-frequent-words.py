# https://leetcode.com/problems/top-k-frequent-words/

# Given an array of strings words and an integer k, return the k most frequent strings.

# Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words
# with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
# Output: ["i","love"]
# Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
# Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.

# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
# Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
# Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of
# occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
