# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-arithmetic-triplets/

# You are given a 0-indexed, strictly increasing integer array nums and a positive integer diff.
# A triplet (i, j, k) is an arithmetic triplet if the following conditions are met:
# - i < j < k,
# - nums[j] - nums[i] == diff, and
# - nums[k] - nums[j] == diff.

# Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

# Example:
# Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# (1, 2, 4) is an arithmetic triplet because both 7 - 4 == 3 and 4 - 1 == 3.
# (2, 4, 5) is an arithmetic triplet because both 10 - 7 == 3 and 7 - 4 == 3.

        triplets = []

        for num in nums:
            if (num - diff in nums) and (num + diff in nums):
                triplets.extend([num, num - diff, num + diff])

        return len(triplets) // 3
