# There are n kids with candies. You are given an integer array candies,
# where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has, and an integer extraCandies,
# denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
#
# Return a boolean array result of length n, where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies,
# they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or false otherwise.
#
# Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.
