# https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/

# An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
# Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

# Example 1:
# Input: n = 6
# Output: true
# Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3

# Example 2:
# Input: n = 1
# Output: true
# Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

# Example 3:
# Input: n = 14
# Output: false
# Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.

class Solution:
    def isUgly(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n < 1:
            return False

        for div in [2, 3, 5]:
            while n % div == 0:
                n //= div

        return n == 1
