# https://leetcode.com/problems/verifying-an-alien-dictionary/

# In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order.
# The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

# Given a sequence of words written in the alien language, and the order of the alphabet,
# return true if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

# Example 1:
# Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: true
# Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.

# Example 2:
# Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.

# Example 3:
# Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Output: false
# Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.)
# According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > 'âˆ…', where 'âˆ…' is defined as the blank character
# which is less than any other character (More info).
